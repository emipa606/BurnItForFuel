&lt;size=16&gt;Select what should be considered fuel.&lt;/size&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Notes:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1.&lt;/b&gt; Deselecting any resource normally used by a building (&lt;i&gt;e.g.&lt;/i&gt; wood logs for the campfire) will disable that building's fuel tab, and it will revert to using only their original fuel.
&lt;b&gt;2.&lt;/b&gt; The Pod Laucher and any other building that allows for fuel level adjustment are also excluded.
&lt;b&gt;3.&lt;/b&gt; Fuel units are always the same for any resource: 1 unit = 1 fuel.
